Recommendation system is an unsupervised learning algorithm (one that does not have a target variable to measure accuracy against) mostly used to aid in consumer decision making. There are different varieties of recommenders that base their predictions on different features. My goal for this project is to create one that is content-based, using elements of the products themselves, and one that is a collaborative item- and user-based using data from amazon reviews. Iâ€™ll look at cosine similarity, aiming for a score of 1 or pairwise distance, aiming for a score of 0, as metrics to measure success and check similarity between items and users.

Just clone the app and run on Jupyter Notebook.

Enjoy!!
